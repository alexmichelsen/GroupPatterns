<p>As core faculty at Antioch University Seattle, Sue Woehrlin has spent the past 29 years supporting adult learners as they pursue individualized degrees in leadership, organizational change and social activism that dynamically interrelate theory with practice.  The heart of her work is teaching the design and facilitation of participatory group processes that involve voices at the margins, engage the whole system, welcome uncertainty and the messiness of emergence, and tap the power of stories to heal, inform, inspire and transform groups.  Sue believes workplaces and communities need effective collaborative groups now more than ever, and enjoys offering pro bono community training and consultation with teams of colleagues and students.</p>
