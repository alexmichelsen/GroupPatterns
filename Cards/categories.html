    Following is a list of the categories (each with the corresponding icon), with a brief description of each category
    and a list of its cards in alphabetical order.  The “Keystone” Pattern­-a summing up or header for that category­-
    is in boldface.  To keep things simple the keystones are not marked on the actual cards.
